# Portfolio

### Profile
I'm a highly motivated mathematics graduate with a passion for data-oriented problem solving. 

I've built a strong foundation of problem solving and solution analysis capability over years of mathematics education while working on data-driven projects that have equipped me with exceptional problem-solving skills and understanding of quantitative analysis.


I'm highly competitive, constantly seeking to better myself and achieve the best possible result while aiming to outperform expectations. I'm a relentless problem solver.



I excel at translating complex data into clear and concise narratives, ensuring a clear understanding for either a technical or non-technical audience.



My greatest quality is that I have a strong desire to learn and continually improve, I hyperfocus on learning technical subjects and I actively seek new knowledge and skills to enhance my technical capabilities and be the best version of me possible.
