### Who I am
I graduated from Aberystwyth University in 2021 with a degree in Mathematics. I kick started my professional career in a banking graduate scheme before pursuing a career in data science and landing my first internship at a local agricultural business as a business analyst, learning key business principles while working directly with the company director, applying and developing my analytical skills.
I'm a life long student of Mathematics with keen interests in data driven solutions and scientific problem solving.
The Tech industry is always evolving and I love being able to grow with it. I always embrace the opportunity to learn new things and develop ideas into practical solutions.
